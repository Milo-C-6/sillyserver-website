    <h1>hi there welcome to the homepage for my silly minecraft server!</h1>
    <p>Hi, I host a private minecraft server intended for me and my friends to enjoy minecraft while we're finished with our school work, or just whenever we have the free time to enjoy.
        <br>It is joinable through eaglercraftX and I provide a client to do so. IP: <span id="eaglerIP"></span>
        <br>It is also joinable through Minecraft java 1.8.8 using the IP: <span id="javaIP"></span></p>
    <p>Interested in joining? If you're in the same district as me then fill this form <a class="external" id="formInner" href="#"></a> &lpar;<strong>You need to be signed into your school email</strong>, if you are and it lets you into the form you are in the same district as me&rpar;</p>
    <p>We have a discord for the members in the server! If you are a player on the minecraft server you can join here <a class="external" id="discordInner" href="#"></a></p>
    <p>I made a guide on how to host a eaglercraftX server the same way I host this one, if that interests you go ahead and <a href="guide/index.html">take a look</a></p>
    <p>Want to contribute to the site? <a class="external" href="https://github.com/Milo-C-6/sillyserver-website">We have a github of the site now!</a></p>

            <p>
                Recently I noticed that it's going to take a while for me to make all the pages I want for this server. So I made a way for you all to help and contribute to the site! If you go to <a class="external" href="https://github.com/Milo-C-6/sillyserver-website">https://github.com/Milo-C-6/sillyserver-website</a> you'll find a repository with all the code for the website, if you have a github account you can make a fork of the repository, edit the things you want of it, and then make a pull request with your new updates! I don't really expect anyone to help and contribute, but if you would like to, there is an option now.
